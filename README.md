__What is this?__

The Warhammer Fantasy Battles Battlescribe Repository looks unmaintained with over 60 open issues and missing a ton of codexes from earlier timeframes.  Rather than attempt to contribute to an unmaintained project I've split off the project with a focus on just 4th and 5th edition - my favorite editions and the favorite editions of Rick Priestley.

Additionally since Battlescribe is defunct - we're using New Recruit.  Don't be party pooper and get on this bus - it's a great program and really the successor to Battlescribe.

__How do I use this to build lists?__

Simply head over to the wiki page https://github.com/Paheej/whfb4th/wiki/How-To-Use-This-Repo-With-New-Recruit to see a guide with screenshots on how to point New Recruit to this repository.
